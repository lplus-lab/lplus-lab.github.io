Some of our early work addressed the sound structure of stored word forms, focusing specifically on the role of alternating sounds in the perception of two English prefixes: <*in-*> and <*un-*>.  These two prefixes provide a convenient pairing because the pronuncation of <*in-*> alternates depending on the stem it is attached to (for instance, *i[n]decent*, *i[m]balanced*), whereas the pronuncation of  <*un-*> is more stable (compare *u[n]detered*, *u[n]becoming*).  

These kinds of sound alternations have been used to argue for theories of word storage which are *underspecified*.  In other words, we might not store as much detail about the pronuncation of `in-' in our memory, because we expect it to change pronuncation in predictable ways.

We tested these predictions in a series of behavioral and electrophysiological (ERP) experiments to see whether subjects could detect mispronounced versions of these prefixes (e.g., *u[m]becoming* or *i[n]balanced*).  All three experiments showed the same pattern of responses which suggest a complicated interplay between two separate systems: one, consistent with an underspecified lexicon where people do have less specific expectations for  <*in-*>, and another utilizing knowledge about how sounds vary in English more generally, making people much more likely to accept `u[m]becoming' as a well-prounounced word compared to something like u[m]tolerable.
