Scientific findings relevant to the d/Deaf community often fail to reach d/Deaf people due to their English reading ability and the costs of sign language translations. Working with <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/gutie34818/eva-gutierrez-sigut-gutierrez">Dr. Gutierrez-Sigut</a> at the University of Essex, we aim to increase access to research in deafness and signed language processing, and promote the co-construction of future research with the d/Deaf community.

So far, we've created a number of bite-sized videos covering resent important research on d/Deaf language processing, reading, and sign language acquisition.  All videos are in British Sign Language (BSL), translated and filmed by our BSL collaborator <a href="https://www.bsl-teacher-directory.co.uk/teachers/2008">Adam Linsdell</a>.

Each video contains a summary of a single published article, pointing out the important findings, why it's important to the Deaf community, and critical commentary to promote engagement with future research.
