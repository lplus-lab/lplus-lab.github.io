It's the end of an era for the (first iteration of the) L+PLUS Lab.  Laurie has wrapped up things at the University of Essex, and the lab is moving west to new pastures at the Unversity of California Davis. 

She leaves behind wonderful colleagues, students, and friends, but there is much to discover on the horizon.  Next check in will be from California!

Here's a last photo of the lab in Colchester with a good reminder to always mind your head.
