Laurie has landed in California!  She's hard at work setting up the L+PLUS Lab on new soil.

First problem -- to locate lab space.  Her new building seems promising at first, but she can't help but notice it also houses the radio transmission tower for KDVS, the student radio station. 

Perhaps it's best to locate the new EEG lab away from the radio tower?
