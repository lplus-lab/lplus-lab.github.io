Publication alert!  L+PLUS Lab members Laurie, Fate and Willem have a new paper out with colleage Kyle Jerro.  This paper looks at noun class processing in Kinyarwanda, a Bantu language of Rwanda.  

If you have an interest in African psycholinguistics, Bantu noun classes, complex morphological systems, or additional language learning and its impact on L1 representations, it's well worth a read!
