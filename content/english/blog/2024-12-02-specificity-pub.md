Another publication from the lab -- this time on the acquistiion of generic and specific markers in bilingual French-English children.  In collaboration with Coralie Herve at the University of Poiters, this work shows interesting effects of bilingual cross-linguistic interference as children work out the subtle differences between article usage in their two languages.
