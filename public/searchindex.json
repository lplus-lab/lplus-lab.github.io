  "content":"The first paper from our Accent the Positive project is out, featuring both Laurie and lab alum Stephanie Martin Vega.\nThis work (see more here) looks at the development of accentism in primary school children. In other words, when do kids start assigning negative and positive value judgements to speakers with different accents? In our data, we find 5-year-olds in Essex already harbor positive associations between the standard accent (Southern Standard British English) and distinguish it from the lesser-valued Essex accent of their own parents.\nThis was a fun one to work on, with Stephanie doing an amazing job keeping 5-year-olds focused and still while we gathered EEG data. The EEG was critical to letting us look at implitic judgements from the kids, adding a lot of nuance to our understanding of how these judgements come about in childhood. Here\u0026rsquo;s to more developmental accent work!\nFind the Whole Paper Here\nAccent the positive: An investigation into five-year-olds’ implicit attitudes towards different regional accents\n"},{

  "content":"Another lab member has successfully defended \u0026ndash; this time we send our biggest congratulations to newly-minted Dr. Xiaoduan Fan!\nHer dissertation explored how Mandarin speakers in China feel about gender-neutral and gender-inclusive language. Across a huge number of participants and multiple studies, she shows that a person\u0026rsquo;s linguistic gender ideologies are shaped by multiple factors including a growing polarization in the younger generations, and the mitigating effects of having personal connections to successful women. This kind of work is sorely needed to understand gender and language in the global context, as very few researchers have looked at linguistic gender ideologies outside of European / Western languages.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re expecting big things for Xiaoduan\u0026rsquo;s future. If you\u0026rsquo;re in need of a brilliant post-doc, I know where to find a good candidate!\n"},{

In other words, not everything we measure in aging shows a pattern of decline.
